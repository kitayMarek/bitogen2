# Bitogen Project Roadmap (Draft)

## Phase 1 – Concept Consolidation
- [x] High‑level documentation (overview, README).
- [x] Scientific whitepaper draft.
- [x] Cipher specification (high‑level).
- [x] Initial example dictionaries.

## Phase 2 – Prototyping
- [ ] Implement reference bitogen tokenizer / detokenizer in Python.
- [ ] Implement simple bitogen→ANS compression prototype.
- [ ] Implement hybrid cipher prototype (using an existing AEAD library).
- [ ] Create test harness and sample datasets.

## Phase 3 – Evaluation
- [ ] Measure compression ratios vs zstd / brotli / CMIX on selected corpora.
- [ ] Measure performance (speed, memory usage).
- [ ] Evaluate structural leakage and traffic analysis resistance.
- [ ] Collect feedback from cryptography and compression researchers.

## Phase 4 – Refinement
- [ ] Improve dictionary learning using AI‑based clustering.
- [ ] Explore domain‑specific dictionaries (logs, binaries, media).
- [ ] Tune hybrid cipher design based on expert feedback.
- [ ] Prepare academic paper submissions (compression / security venues).

## Phase 5 – Stabilization & Outreach
- [ ] Clean, documented reference implementation.
- [ ] Example notebooks / demos.
- [ ] Public presentations or blog posts.
- [ ] Invite collaborators via GitHub Issues / Discussions.
