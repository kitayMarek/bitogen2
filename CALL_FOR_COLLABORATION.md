# 🤝 Call for Collaboration: Bitogen Research Initiative

The Bitogen project explores a new concept in binary data representation:
**a symbolic layer (bitogens) sitting between raw bits and higher-level processing.**

This touches multiple fields:
- compression
- cryptography
- data representation
- binary modeling
- tokenization
- AI/ML preprocessing

Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential.
